# Recordings

These are the recordings of the sessions of the training course held on 4 December, 2024.
  
* [Session 1](https://vimeo.com/1036139176):
  In this session, we provided a guided tour of RStudio.
- [Session 2](https://vimeo.com/1036140288):
  In this session, we introduced RStudio projects, installing packages, writing R code, writing R scripts.
- [Session 3](https://vimeo.com/1036140989):
  In this session, we read in a csv file into RStudio as a data frame, looked at the data frame different way, selected 
      columns with `select`, filtered rows with `filter`, did a t-test, simple linear regression, multiple
      linear regression, one-way Anova, pairwise comparisons.


And these are the recordings of the sessions of the second day of the training course held on 15 January, 2025.

* [Session 1](https://vimeo.com/videos/1047391238): In this session, we data cleaning using tidyverse/dpylr tools like select, filter, mutate
* [Session 1 (missing clip)](https://vimeo.com/videos/1047406300): This is the missing clip that occurred after around 45 minutes in Session 1
* [Session 2](https://vimeo.com/videos/1047391822): In this session, initially, we primarily cover data visualization using ggplot and then transition to generalized linear models, particularly binary logistic regression.
* [Session 3](https://vimeo.com/videos/1047392423): In this session, we continue with binary logistic regression and also introduction linear mixed effects models.
