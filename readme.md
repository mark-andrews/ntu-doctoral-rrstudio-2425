# R/RStudio training course

This two-day course provides a basic and more advanced introduction to R and RStudio.

## Day 1: Introduction to R and RStudio

R is a program for doing statistical data analysis, and RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (or IDE) for using R. Both R and RStudio are free and open source software, available on all the major platforms (Windows, Macs, Linux) and now used by millions of people around the world for data analysis in settings such as academic scientific research, business data analytics, data analysis in the medical and health sector, and in fact in almost every other setting where data analysis is done. The purpose of this course is to provide a comprehensive introduction to R and RStudio. We can't cover everything that R can do. R has a vast number of tools. The aim therefore is just to introduce the general basics of R, how we use R through RStudio, and to introduce most of the common or general things that we do whenever we are doing any statistical data analysis with R. These include reading in data from files, reformatting and transforming data, statistically summarizing and exploring and visualizing data. We also show how to use R to do many of the basic statistical tests or statistical models that are widely used in data analysis; things like t-tests, correlation, simple and multiple linear regression, analysis of variance (also known as ANOVA).

## Day 2: R and RStudio for more advanced users

This course is intended for people who are already familiar with R and RStudio. In it, we delve into more depth on how to use R for more advanced and more efficient data analysis.  In particular, we will provide a more in-depth introduction to data wrangling, data visualization, and more advanced statistical analyses. Data wrangling is the art of taking raw and messy data and formatting and cleaning it so that data analysis and visualization etc may be performed on it. Done poorly, it can be a time consuming, laborious, and error-prone. Fortunately, the tools provided by R's tidyverse package allow us to do data wrangling in a fast, efficient, and high-level manner, which can have dramatic consequence for ease and speed with which we analyse data. In this course, we also go into more depth and detail on using R for visualizing univariate, bivariate and multivariate data using the powerful ggplot package. We also cover more advanced statistical analysis including binary logistic regression, ordinal logistic regression, multinomial logistic regression, Poisson and negative binomial regression, and mixed effects linear and generalized linear models (also known as multilevel models). 


## Schedule 

On each day, the course will take 5hr + 30 mins contact hours with two 2-hour breaks. The sessions will be as follows:

* Session 1: 9:30am-11:30am;
* Session 2: 12:30am-2:30pm;
* Session 3: 3:30pm-17:00pm

## Software

In addition to RStudio, we will use the following R packages:

* `tidyverse`
* `MASS`
* `pscl`
* `lme4`
